## Project Title
Rock-Paper-Scissors Console Game

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to implement a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game that can be played directly in the console. This project serves as a demonstration of basic programming concepts, including user input handling, conditional logic, and simple randomization.

## Solution
The solution involves creating a console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game where a user can play against the computer. Here’s how we solve the problem:

1. User Input: We prompt the user to enter their choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
2. Computer Choice: The computer randomly selects between "rock", "paper", and "scissors".
3. Game Logic: Using conditional statements, we compare the user’s choice with the computer’s choice to determine the winner based on the standard rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
4. Output: We display the choices of both the user and the computer, and announce the result of the game (win, lose, or draw).

## Technologies and Tools Used
### Programming Language: 
Python
### Libraries: 
No external libraries are needed, only standard Python libraries are used.
### Development Environment: 
Any environment that supports Python, such as VSCode, PyCharm, or even a simple text editor combined with a terminal.
